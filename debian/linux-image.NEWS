linux-latest (76) unstable; urgency=medium

  * From Linux 4.8, several changes have been made in the kernel
    configuration to 'harden' the system, i.e. to mitigate security bugs.
    Some changes may cause legitimate applications to fail, and can be
    reverted by run-time configuration:
    - On most architectures, the /dev/mem device can no longer be used to
      access devices that also have a kernel driver.  This breaks dosemu
      and some old user-space graphics drivers.  To allow this, set the
      kernel parameter: iomem=relaxed
    - The kernel log is no longer readable by unprivileged users.  To
      allow this, set the sysctl: kernel.dmesg_restrict=0

  * From Linux 4.7, the iptables connection tracking system will no longer
    automatically load helper modules.  If your firewall configuration
    depends on connection tracking helpers, you should explicitly load the
    required modules.  For more information, see
